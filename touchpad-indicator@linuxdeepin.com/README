touchpad-indicator is a minimalist Touchpad management extension for the Gnome Shell.

touchpad-indicator allows you to switch your Touchpad On or Off.

If the program "synclient" installed on your pc and you've got a Synaptics Touchpad which use synclient it's possible to disable only Tap and Scroll and not the whole touchpad.
You have to set 'SYNCLIENT_EXISTS' on line 38 to 'true' to enable synclient.
Attention! Set only to 'true' if you have a Synaptics touchpad which use 'synclient' exits on your PC, otherwise gnome-shell will crash while start. You could test this before change this setting by typing 'synclient -l' in a terminal. If the output looks like:
'Couldn't find synaptics properties. No synaptics driver loaded?'
You haven't a synaptics touchpad and you never should set SYNCLIENT_EXISTS to 'true'.
If the output looks similar to:
Parameter settings:
    LeftEdge                = 1752
    RightEdge               = 5192
    TopEdge                 = 1620
...
You could turn 'SYNCLIENT_EXISTS' to 'true' and there shouldn't be problems. 


Also it is possible to automatically switch off the touchpad at startup of gnome-shell, if a mouse is detected. Default is that the touchpad is disabled if a mouse is detected.

To choose your preferred option you could modify the extension.js file and change the values at line 37 and 38.


To install, extract the archive or copy the folder to
~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/ and restart the shell.
